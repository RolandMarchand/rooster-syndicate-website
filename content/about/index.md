Rooster Syndicate is an Indie Dev Studio, currently ran by myself - Malone - as I work with friends and freelancers to make games of all kinds!

Currently working on two big projects:

- A murder mystery game, inspired by the Ace Attorney series, Danganronpa, and Your Turn to Die.
- An analog horror game, inspired by Petscop, Home Safety Hotline, and the original Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s (demo currently on Steam below!)
